                    <li>1 cup water</li>

                    <li>1 cup lemon juice about 8 large lemons</li>

     <h4>Instructions</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Simple Syrup</b>
                        To a microwave-safe bowl, add hot water along with the sugar.
                        Microwave for 30 seconds. 
                        Take it out and mix. Microwave for another 30 seconds. 
                        Take it out and mix again. If it is clear and all the sugar is dissolved, it's done. 
                        If you still see sugar, microwave for another 30 seconds.
                        Once clear, pop in the fridge to cool down to room temperature.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><b>Strawberry Juice</b>
                        To a food processor, add the strawberries and water. 
                        Blend until there is no more chunks and completely smooth like a juice.
                        Place a fine sieve over a bowl and strain the juice to remove the seeds. 
                        If it is pouring very slowly, just swirl it around with a spoon and press
                         gently against the sieve and it will filter out a lot faster.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><b>To make the lemonade!</b>
                        To a very large pitcher, add the lemon juice and water along with all the strawberry juice and 1 cup of the simple syrup. 
                        Taste it. If you want it more sweet, add the rest of the simple syrup. 
                        If you want a less strong taste, dilute it with a little bit of water. I did not add any extra water 
                        and used all the syrup and the taste was perfect for me.
                        Place in the fridge to chill or serve in a glass with ice immediately and enjoy!
